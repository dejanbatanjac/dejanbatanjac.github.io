Usually when investigating a new system we need to understand the what we are dealing with. We need  to discover the existing items, or entities.

### The list of Loss functions

To execute backpropagation algorithm you need to have loss function in order to calculate the error. You can create your own loss function or use one from the list:

    L1Loss
    MSELoss
    CrossEntropyLoss
    CTCLoss
    NLLLoss
    PoissonNLLLoss
    KLDivLoss
    BCELoss
    BCEWithLogitsLoss
    MarginRankingLoss
    HingeEmbeddingLoss
    MultiLabelMarginLoss
    SmoothL1Loss
    SoftMarginLoss
    MultiLabelSoftMarginLoss
    CosineEmbeddingLoss
    MultiMarginLoss
    TripletMarginLoss
