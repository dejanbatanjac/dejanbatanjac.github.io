<p>You will find here <code class="highlighter-rouge">posts</code> about artificial intelligence most of the time.</p>

<p>Current themes of interest would be :</p>
<ul>
  <li>The TensorFlow and Keras</li>
  <li>The PyTorch (another machine learning library for Python)</li>
  <li><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/">ConvNetJs</a> (JavaScript machine learning library)</li>
  <li>all other tools and papers helping me understand the machine learning process</li>
</ul>

<p>I will certainly focus some articles on the latest TensorFlow 2.0 that you may install via this command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Since GitHub is one of the greatest code repositories online there will be some searching methods explained helping us to grab good quality data.</code></p>

<p>You can do machine learning in many languages, but Python would probable be the very first choice if you havenâ€™t worked with the R programming language.</p>

<p>I will also provide some learning articles in Python, R, JavaScript, Ruby and Go.</p>

<p>There will be interesting time generating and visualizing the ML models.</p>
