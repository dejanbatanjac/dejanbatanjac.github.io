Scikit-learn is fully open source machine learning framework in Python. You can contribute.

It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.

Scikit fits well to all kind of ML tasks:


## Classification

    Identifying to which category an object belongs to.
    Applications: Spam detection, Image recognition.
    Algorithms: 

    SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, …


## Regression

    Predicting a continuous-valued attribute associated with an object.
    Applications: Drug response, Stock prices.
    Algorithms: 

    SVR, ridge regression, Lasso, …



## Clustering

    Automatic grouping of similar objects into sets.
    Applications: Customer segmentation, Grouping experiment outcomes
    Algorithms: 

    k-Means, spectral clustering, mean-shift, …



## Dimensionality reduction

    Reducing the number of random variables to consider.
    Applications: Visualization, Increased efficiency
    Algorithms: 

    PCA, feature selection, non-negative matrix factorization.

## Model selection

    Comparing, validating and choosing parameters and models.
    Goal: Improved accuracy via parameter tuning
    Modules: 

    grid search, cross validation, metrics.

## Preprocessing

    Feature extraction and normalization.
    Application: Transforming input data such as text for use with machine learning algorithms.
    Modules: 

    preprocessing, feature extraction.
