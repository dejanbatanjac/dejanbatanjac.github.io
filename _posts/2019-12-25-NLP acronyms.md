Wanted to have a summary of he NLP acronyms and common tasks.


## Acronyms in NLP

* LM Language Modelling (predicting the next word given the previous context)
* NLP Natural Language Processing
* NLG Natural Language Generation 
* NLU Natural Language Understanding 
* NLI Natural Language Inference
* NED Named Entity Disambiguation
* NER Named Entity Recognition
* NMT Neural Machine Translation 
* BPE Byte Pair Encoding 
* NSP Next Sentence Prediction (like Bert)
* MLM Masked Language Model (Like Bert)
* CLM Causal Language Model (like GPT2)
* RTE Recognizing Textual Entailment (pair of sentences, and the task is to predict whether the first entails the second; part of GLUE)
* MRPC Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (pair of sentences, labeled as almost semantically equivalent, or no, part of GLUE)
