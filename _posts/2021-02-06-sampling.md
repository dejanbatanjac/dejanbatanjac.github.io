## Sampling from Gaussian distribution 


In here we will sample 3000 points form the Gaussian distribution $\mathcal N(3,2)$ and after that get $\mu$ and $\sigma$ from the samples.


```python
import numpy as np
from numpy import random
x = random.normal(loc=3, scale=2, size=(3000))
N = len(x) # length of gaussian samples
print(N) 
mu = x.mean()
print(mu) # mean
sigma = np.sqrt(((x-mu)**2).sum()/N)
print(sigma) # sigma
```

Out:

```
3000
3.0343101612162453
1.9620811647405432
```

## Sampling from 2 Gaussian distributions

Now we will have two Gaussian distribution $\mathcal N(3,2)$  and $\mathcal N(5,5)$  and we try to get both back.
