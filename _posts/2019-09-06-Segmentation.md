For segmentation problems we have the input dimension is [N x C x H x W]

    N -> the batch size
    C -> channels 
    H -> image height
    W -> image width

and the output dimension [N x C x H x W]

    N -> the batch size
    C -> number of classes in dataset (possible segments)
    H -> image height
    W -> image width
