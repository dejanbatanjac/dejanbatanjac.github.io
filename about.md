You will find here `posts` about artificial intelligence most of the time. 

You can do machine learning in many languages, but Python would probable be the very first choice. This defined my machine learning direction long time ago.

Current themes of interest would be :
* The PyTorch (another machine learning library for Python)
* The TensorFlow and Keras
* math, especially probability theory (Bayesian approach)
* all other tools, papers, courses helping me understand the machine learning process

I like to update my posts just like machine learning algorithms update their neural networks.
If you like some of the post consider sharing them. That would help.
