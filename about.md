You will find here `posts` about artificial intelligence most of the time. 

Current themes of interest would be :
* The PyTorch (another machine learning library for Python)
* The TensorFlow and Keras
* all other tools and papers helping me understand the machine learning process

Since GitHub is one of the greatest code repositories online there will be some searching methods explained helping us to grab good quality data.

You can do machine learning in many languages, but Python would probable be the very first choice.
